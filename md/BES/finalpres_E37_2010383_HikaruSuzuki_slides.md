Making slides by TEXT

### Only Reveal.js

Other softwares<br>
<small>PPT and other WYSWYG, Marp and other coded apps</small><br>
don't have nesting like this.

Only reveal.js<br>
and "powered by" it (https://slides.com/)

## Faster than PPT

**Less mouse moving**

**Prepared functions**
* Many Styles: easy to see (Color/Font/Size)
* Centering and Stretching

and so on...

→ Writing less than what you get
