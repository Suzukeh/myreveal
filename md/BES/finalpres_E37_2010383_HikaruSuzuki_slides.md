Making slides by TEXT

> reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework.

HTML / Markdown ←I recommend

## Text-to-Slide system

Markdown slide<br>

## Nesting by Chapters

<img src="img/07-08-11-57-11.png" style="width: 50%; border: solid; box-shadow:none;transform:rotate(0deg)"/>

→ Writing as Chapter

--

### Only Reveal.js

Other softwares<br>
<small>PPT and other WYSWYG, Marp and other coded apps</small><br>
**NO** nesting like this.

## Faster than PPT

**Less mouse moving**

**Prepared functions**
* Many Styles: easy to see Color/Font/Size
* Centering and Stretching

and so on...

→ Writing LESS than what you get
